In this lesson we learnt about the Caesar cipher and also how to create one in our google spreadsheets. We had to apply past knowledge of vlookup's as well as learning new things such as basic formatting and how to add more rows to our spreadsheet. Once we managed to create a functioning code creater we learnt how to put it all in one box with concatenate.
