This lesson we changed teachers bringing along the final third before our GCSE choices kicked in, scary. However Repl.IT was our main focus and I tried to stay on course and I think I succeeded. My work was on topic and I was understanding it all however I lost my work as Repl decided to delete itself and I'm lacking a lot of work.
