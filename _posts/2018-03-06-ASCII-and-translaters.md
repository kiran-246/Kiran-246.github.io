This was one of my favourite IT leesons with the class taking part in a large discussion for a good part of it. We talked about binary coding, 8 bit and how this is translated into the ABC's that I’m typing right now. Then using the table that we took from a website plus our old knowledge of caesar codes to create a vlookup code which creates a translator from letters, numbers and symbols into the 0’s and 1’s we use in binary.
