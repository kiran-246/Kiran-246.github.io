In this lesson we came in and sat down then signed in like normal. This lesson we had a cover as our teacher wasn't present. I spent the whole lesson trying to work out how to put in product codes. I tried my hardest and even worked with my fellow pupil for around ten minutes but even our combined brain power could not sort the problem.
