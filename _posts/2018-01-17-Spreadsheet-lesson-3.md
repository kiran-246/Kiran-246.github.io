In this lesson we came in, sat down and logged in to our google accounts like every single lesson we have had for IT since year 7. In this lesson I spent it all trying to find out how to put discounts into my spreadsheets. I tried all the options I could think of even using things from stuff like codecademy. In the end with a little help from my teacher, I managed to get it.
